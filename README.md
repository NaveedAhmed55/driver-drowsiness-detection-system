# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`driver-drowsiness-detection-system.ipynb`) implementing a driver drowsiness detection system using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocesses images for training and testing.
- Implements convolutional neural network (CNN) models for classification.
- Evaluates model performance using confusion matrices.
- Predicts drowsiness based on input images.
- Saves trained models for future use.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in a Python environment supporting Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed.
3. Run each cell sequentially to train models, evaluate performance, and make predictions.

## Dataset

The notebook uses a dataset containing images of drivers exhibiting various levels of drowsiness.
